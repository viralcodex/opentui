/**
 * Regression test for: Native Yoga crash when renderer.destroy() is called
 * with pending React state updates.
 *
 * Bug report: https://gist.github.com/rauchg/b2e1e964f88773a5d08f5f682dce2224
 *
 * Issue: When calling renderer.destroy() while async operations (intervals,
 * promises, etc.) are still updating React state, Yoga crashes with:
 * "Cannot add child: Nodes with measure functions cannot have children."
 * followed by "RuntimeError: Out of bounds memory access"
 *
 * The crash happens because:
 * 1. renderer.destroy() is called (WITHOUT unmounting React first)
 * 2. This calls root.destroyRecursively() which calls yogaNode.free() on all nodes
 * 3. The interval keeps firing setLines() because React wasn't unmounted
 * 4. React tries to re-render, calling appendChild() which calls add()
 * 5. add() calls yogaNode.insertChild() on a freed (parent) yoga node
 * 6. Yoga WASM crashes with out-of-bounds memory access
 *
 * The "Cannot add child: Nodes with measure functions cannot have children"
 * error message is misleading - it's actually a use-after-free crash where
 * the freed yoga node's memory has been reused/corrupted.
 *
 * CRITICAL: The bug only occurs when React is NOT unmounted before/during destroy.
 * In the bug report, there is NO root.unmount() call - just renderer.destroy().
